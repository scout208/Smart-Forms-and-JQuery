# Smart-Forms-and-JQuery
Using JQueryUI, JQuery, HTML5 Validation, and PHP.

Using JQueryUI for the UI elements. There are 3 tabs that change the text on the page based on their selection. 

When the "Join Us!" button is selected, a form is revealed using JQuery. 

When the "Submit Application" button is pressed, HTML5 form validation is used to make sure that all fields have appropriate values. If they are all valid, PHP is used to generate a response at the bottom of the page. (You may need to scroll down to see it)
